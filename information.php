They offer great benefits, but are also costly and last for only 25 years. This potentially means you will need to dispose of them down the line. In any house considering Solar Panels, choosing to install them for economic reasons is a bad idea if you're not planning to live in the house for at least 8 years. Yet, Solar Panels also add great value to the house due to their versatility in summer months to enable you to go off-grid.</p>
